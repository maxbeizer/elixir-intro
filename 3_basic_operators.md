### Basic Operators

```
+ - * /                  # arithmetic operators
div/2                    # division
rem/2                    # remainder
++ --                    # to manipulate lists
"foo" <> "bar"           # string concatenation, i.e. "foobar"
or and not               # boolean operators that expect booleans, or and are short-circuit
|| && !                  # everything except false and nil are true
== != === !== <= >= < >  # comparison

1 == 1.0                 # true
1 === 1.0                # false
```
